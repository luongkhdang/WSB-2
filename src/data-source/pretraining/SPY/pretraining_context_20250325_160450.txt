PRETRAINING INSIGHTS:

2. 2025-03-20 (reflection_daily) - Accuracy: high
   Error Assessment: Predicted 0-0.5% rangebound, actual was 0.00% - Accurate within the predicted range.
   Learning: In highly stable market conditions (stable VIX, neutral SPY), a conservative, rangebound prediction is often the most accurate.

4. 2025-03-20 (reflection_intraday) - Accuracy: high
   Error Assessment: Predicted 0-0.5% movement, actual was 0.00% - Accurate within 0.5%.
   Learning: In neutral market conditions, prioritize strategies that minimize risk and avoid directional bets, even if potential profit is limited.

6. 2025-03-21 (reflection_intraday) - Accuracy: high
   Error Assessment: Predicted 0-0.5% movement, actual was 0.00% - Accurate to within 0.5%.
   Learning: When the broader market is neutral and volatility is stable, prioritize avoiding directional strategies like credit spreads and focus on identifying opportunities where volatility expansion is likely.


CONCLUSIONS FROM PRETRAINING:
- Overall prediction accuracy: 8.0/10
- Key insights:
  * In highly stable market conditions (stable VIX, neutral SPY), a conservative, rangebound prediction is often the most accurate.
  * In neutral market conditions, prioritize strategies that minimize risk and avoid directional bets, even if potential profit is limited.
  * When the broader market is neutral and volatility is stable, prioritize avoiding directional strategies like credit spreads and focus on identifying opportunities where volatility expansion is likely.

CREDIT SPREAD STRATEGY IMPLICATIONS:
1. In neutral market environments, prioritize tight strike selection for 7-15 DTE credit spreads to maximize theta decay, even if potential profit is limited. Focus on minimizing spread width rather than attempting to capture large price movements.
2. In periods of low volatility and neutral market trends, favor tighter credit spreads with minimal width, or consider alternative strategies that are less reliant on directional movement, such as iron condors.
3. In situations with neutral market trends and stable VIX, avoid initiating 7-15 DTE credit spreads. If a strategy is necessary, consider iron condors with very wide strikes to capitalize on time decay without significant directional risk, or explore alternative strategies like calendar spreads.
