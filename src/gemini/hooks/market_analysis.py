    return f'''
    Analyze the market trend based on multiple major indices data:
    
    {market_data}
    
    TODAY'S DATE: [TODAY'S DATE]
    Follow these rules exactly:
    1. Analyze each major index (SPY, QQQ, IWM, VTV, VGLT):
       - SPY (S&P 500): Overall market benchmark
       - QQQ (Nasdaq 100): Technology and growth stocks
       - IWM (Russell 2000): Small-cap stocks
       - VTV (Vanguard Value): Value stocks
       - VGLT (Long-Term Treasury): Bond market indicator
      For each:
       - Check daily price change (%) and trend via 9/21 EMA on daily AND 1-hour charts.
       - Trend: Price > both EMAs (bullish), < both EMAs (bearish), mixed (neutral).
       - Note key support/resistance levels (e.g., prior highs/lows, 50-day SMA).
       
    2. For each index check the 9/21 EMA on 1-hour chart:
       - Price > 9/21 EMA: Bullish trend (+2 to Market Trend score per index)
       - Price < 9/21 EMA: Bearish trend (+2 if bearish setup per index)
       - Flat/No crossover: Neutral (no bonus)
       Market Trend Scoring:
       - Assign +1 per bullish index, -1 per bearish index (daily EMA basis).
       - Adjust for VIX: <15 (+3), 15-20 (+2), 20-25 (0), 25-30 (-2), >30 (-4).
       - Max score: +10 (strong bull), min: -10 (strong bear).
    
    3. Check for market divergences:
       - SPY vs QQQ: Growth vs Broad Market
       - SPY vs IWM: Small Cap vs Large Cap strength 
       - SPY vs VTV: Growth vs Value rotation
       - VGLT trend: Inverse relationship with equities typically
    
    4. Check VIX level:
       - Current VIX level and 5-day trend (rising/falling).
       - Implications for credit spreads: High VIX (>25) favors wider spreads for premium; low VIX (<15) suggests tighter spreads or iron condors.

    
    5. Options sentiment analysis:
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio: >1.5 (bullish), 0.8-1.2 (neutral), <0.8 (bearish).
       - IV Skew: Call IV - Put IV (>5% bullish, <-5% bearish).
       - 30-day IV vs. HV (historical volatility): Overpriced options signal credit spread opportunities.
       - Open Interest: Rising OI in out-of-the-money (OTM) puts or calls as directional bias.
       - Call IV > Put IV by >5%: Strongly bullish direction (+7 to Sentiment)
       - Call IV > Put IV by <5%: Mildly bullish direction (+3 to Sentiment)
       - Put IV > Call IV by <5%: Mildly bearish direction (+3 to Sentiment)
       - Put IV > Call IV by >5%: Strongly bearish direction (+7 to Sentiment)
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio > 1.5: Strong bullish bias (+7)
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio 1.1-1.5: Mild bullish bias (+3)
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio 0.9-1.1: Neutral (0)
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio 0.5-0.9: Mild bearish bias (+3)
       - Call/Put Volume Ratio < 0.5: Strong bearish bias (+7)
    
    6. Sector Rotation Analysis:
       - Compare daily % changes of SPY, QQQ, IWM, VTV, and sector ETFs (e.g., XLK, XLF, XLY) via web search if data unavailable.
       - Identify leadership: QQQ/XLK (tech), IWM (small-caps), VTV/XLF (value/financials), VGLT (safety).
       - Link to credit spreads: Leading sectors for bullish puts, lagging for bearish calls.
       - Identify the best and worst performing indices
       - Analyze what this means for market sentiment
       - QQQ leading: Tech/Growth leadership
       - IWM leading: Small cap strength, risk-on environment
       - VTV leading: Defensive positioning, value over growth
       - VGLT leading: Safety trade, potential risk-off environment
       - Detect if small caps are leading or lagging large caps
       
    7. Market Divergences:
       - SPY vs. QQQ: Tech vs. broad market strength.
       - SPY vs. IWM: Large vs. small-cap leadership.
       - SPY vs. VTV: Growth vs. value rotation.
       - SPY vs. VGLT: Risk-on (equities up, bonds down) vs. risk-off.

    8. Real-Time Catalysts (use web/X search):
       - Policy Watch: Latest statements from Trump, Fed, or Treasury (e.g., tariff news, rate cut calls).
       - Economic Calendar: Key releases (e.g., PCE, PMI) from sites like Investing.com.
       - X Sentiment: Search posts for "market trend" or "SPY" to gauge retail mood.
    !IMPORTANT: Credit Spread Trading Outlook:
       - Trend alignment: Bullish (sell put spreads), bearish (sell call spreads), neutral (iron condors).
       - Strike selection: Use support/resistance and IV to pick OTM strikes with >70% POP.
       - Risk management: VIX >30 (half size), max loss <2% of account.
