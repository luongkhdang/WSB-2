PRIORITY - HIGH:
Workflow and Expected Steps
Based on your clarification:
Data Fetch: Historical data from 2025-01-24 onward is used to calculate indicators (MACD, RSI, ATR) for context.

Analysis Period: March 20–24, 2025.

Steps:
Step 1: 1mo/1d, March 20—daily data from Feb 23 to March 20 (25 trading days, assuming Feb 23 is a typo for Feb 20 or adjusted for weekends).

Step 2: 5d/15m, March 20—15-minute intraday data for March 20.

Step 3: 5d/15m, March 21—15-minute intraday data for March 21.

Step 4: 5d/15m, March 22—15-minute intraday data for March 22.

Step 5: 5d/15m, March 23—15-minute intraday data for March 23.

Step 6: 5d/15m, March 24—15-minute intraday data for March 24.

The provided data only covers:
Step 2 (2025-03-20, 15m).

Step 3 (2025-03-21, 15m).

Step 4 (2025-03-24, 15m, mislabeled as Step 4 but should be Step 6).

Summary (2025-01-24, misaligned with March focus).

Missing: Step 1 (1mo/1d), Step 4 (March 22), Step 5 (March 23), and a corrected Summary for March 20–24.
Identified Errors/Issues with the Provided Data

1. Missing Steps
   Issue: Steps 1, 4, and 5 are absent.
   Step 1 (1mo/1d, March 20): No daily data from Feb 23 (or Feb 20) to March 20 is provided to establish the broader trend, despite its role in setting the "secret" baseline trend (neutral, 60% confidence).

Step 4 (5d/15m, March 22): No intraday analysis for March 22.

Step 5 (5d/15m, March 23): No intraday analysis for March 23.

Impact: Without Step 1, the baseline trend lacks context (e.g., how was 60% confidence derived?). Missing Steps 4 and 5 break the daily continuity, making it impossible to track intraday evolution from March 20–24.

Recommendation: Generate Step 1 using daily data (e.g., price, volume, indicators from Feb 20–March 20) and infer Steps 4 and 5 based on trends from Steps 2, 3, and 6 (March 24, mislabeled as Step 4).

2. Step Mislabeling
   Issue: The provided "Step 4" (2025-03-24) should be Step 6 per the workflow.
   Problem: The original sequence skips March 22 and 23, and labels March 24 as Step 4 instead of Step 6.

Impact: This mislabeling disrupts the intended 5-day intraday progression.

Recommendation: Relabel the provided "Step 4" as Step 6 and note the absence of Steps 4 and 5.

3. Summary Date Mismatch
   Issue: The Summary is dated "2025-01-24 – 2025-01-24," while the analysis should cover March 20–24.
   Problem: The January date likely reflects the data fetch start (for indicators), not the analysis period. The Summary assumes SPY at $485, far below the March range (~558–575).

Impact: The Summary doesn’t synthesize the March 20–24 steps and uses an outdated price assumption.

Recommendation: Update the Summary to "2025-03-20 – 2025-03-24," adjust the SPY price to ~565 (March average), and synthesize findings from all 6 steps (inferring missing ones if needed).

4. Inconsistent Price and Indicator Continuity
   Issue: Price ranges and indicators don’t align across the provided steps, and missing steps exacerbate this.
   Step 2 (March 20): Range 562.60–570.57, current 565.69, VWAP 566.47, MACD 0, ATR 1.54%.

Step 3 (March 21): Range 558.03–564.89, current 564.19, VWAP 561.39, MACD 0, RSI 64.09, ATR 1.3738%.

Step 6 (March 24, mislabeled Step 4): Range 570.20–575.15, VWAP 573.26, MACD 0, ATR 0.7857%, no current price.

Problem:
Price drops from 565.69 (March 20) to 558.03–564.89 (March 21), then jumps to 570.20–575.15 (March 24) without Steps 4 and 5 to explain the transition.

RSI is only provided in Step 3; MACD is consistently 0 (neutral), but ATR fluctuates without trend justification.

Impact: Gaps prevent a coherent narrative of price and momentum shifts.

Recommendation: Infer Steps 4 and 5 prices (e.g., gradual rise from 564.19 to 570.20) and ensure indicators reflect daily data from Step 1.

5. Strategy and Volatility Discrepancies
   Issue: Strategy shifts and volatility data lack continuity.
   Step 2: Iron condor, IV 1.36%, HV 1.09%.

Step 3: Iron condor, IV 1.2175%, HV 0.9740%.

Step 6 (mislabeled Step 4): Bear call spread, IV 0.68%, HV unspecified.

Summary: Iron condor, IV/HV unknown.

Problem:
Step 6 switches to bear call spread due to iron condor’s 0% success, but the Summary reverts to iron condor without addressing this.

IV drops sharply from 1.2175% to 0.68% by March 24, unexplained without Steps 4 and 5.

Impact: Strategy flip-flopping and volatility gaps undermine reliability.

Recommendation: Infer IV trends in Steps 4 and 5 (e.g., gradual decline), justify the Summary’s iron condor choice, or align it with Step 6’s bear call spread.

6. Risk/Reward Errors (Repeated from Prior Analysis)
   Issue: Risk/reward ratios remain inconsistent.
   Step 2: 1:2 (credit 0.50, risk 1.00) – correct.

Step 3: 1:2 (credit $0.50, risk $2.50) – should be 1:5.

Step 6 (Step 4): 2:1 (profit $50, risk $25) – should be 1:2.

Summary: 1:9 (profit $45, risk $500) – plausible but high risk; later ratios vary (1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3).

Recommendation: Correct Step 3 to 1:5, Step 6 to 1:2, and standardize Summary ratios based on strike widths.
