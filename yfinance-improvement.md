Current Implementation Analysis
Rate Limit Exposure:
The client makes multiple API calls in quick succession without consolidated requests
The get_complete_analysis() method makes 5+ separate API calls that could trigger rate limiting
No explicit rate limiting or throttling mechanisms beyond basic backoff
Caching Implementation:
Uses a DataCache class with configurable TTLs (default 4-24 hours)
use_cache=True by default, which helps reduce API calls
Cache organized by function name and parameters
Error Handling:
Uses @backoff for retrying failed requests with exponential backoff
Error handling returns empty DataFrames rather than None in many cases
Falls back to synthetic data generation for testing in some scenarios
Request Patterns:
Hardcoded time periods (e.g., "5d", "6mo", "1y") that don't consider rate limits
Uses multiple intervals and timeframes (hourly, daily, weekly) increasing API load
Downloads complete data even when partial data might suffice

Here’s a concise summary of yfinance limits and rate limits based on its functionality and reliance on Yahoo Finance’s unofficial API:
Data Limits
Daily Data (e.g., 1d interval):
Historical Range: Up to the ticker’s full history (e.g., SPY goes back to 1993, ~8,000+ trading days).

Max Fetch: No strict cap; period="max" retrieves all available daily data.

Intraday Data (e.g., 1m, 5m, 15m intervals):
Historical Range: Up to 60 days total.

Per Request:
1-minute (1m): 7 days max per call.

Other intervals (e.g., 5m, 15m): Up to 60 days in one request.

Workaround: Loop in 7-day chunks to get the full 60 days for 1m data.

Period Parameter Options:
Predefined: 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max.

Custom: Use start and end dates for arbitrary ranges within available history.

Rate Limits
Unofficial API Nature: yfinance scrapes Yahoo Finance, which doesn’t publish an official rate limit, so limits are implicit and subject to change.

Practical Limit:
~500-600 requests per hour (based on community reports and anecdotal evidence).

Exceeding this may trigger temporary IP blocks or CAPTCHA prompts from Yahoo.

No Explicit Quota: Unlike official APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage’s 25/day free), there’s no fixed cap, but aggressive scraping risks throttling or bans.

Factors Affecting Limits:
Frequent requests in a short time (e.g., <1 second apart) increase block risk.

Concurrent requests or multiple tickers can hit limits faster.
