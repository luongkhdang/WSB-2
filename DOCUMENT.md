# WSB-2: The Seriously Questionable Credit Spread System

*For when your retirement fund isn't losing money fast enough*

## The Hard Truth

This system attempts to make money in one of the most statistically challenging ways possible: options trading. Congratulations on choosing violence.

## System Components

### YFinance Client
Gets market data that's delayed just enough to ensure you never get the fills you want.

### Gemini AI Client
Analyzes data using an AI that knows about as much about trading as your drunk uncle at Thanksgiving.

### Notion Client
Documents your losses with pretty charts so you can show your therapist why you're depressed.

### Discord Client
Sends alerts directly to your phone so you can panic-check them during important meetings.

## The "Strategy"

### Quality Matrix
Scores trades on a 100-point scale where:
- 90-100: Too good to be true (it is)
- 70-89: Will look genius until it isn't
- 50-69: Mediocre but survivable
- 0-49: Just Venmo me directly instead

### Gamble Matrix
For when you want to feel like you're in a casino but with more spreadsheets.

## How It Actually Works

1. System identifies "promising" high IV stocks (translation: stocks about to move violently against you)
2. You place carefully calculated credit spreads
3. Stock immediately breaches your short strike
4. You roll the position until expiration or death (whichever comes first)
5. Repeat until account blows up
6. Post loss porn on r/wallstreetbets
7. Start over with fresh capital

## Risk Management

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

*Fine, here's the real advice:*
- Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
- Manage positions at 2x credit received or 50% profit, whichever comes first
- Exit when your thesis is invalidated, not when your emotions are validated

## Final Words

Trading credit spreads is like playing chess against an opponent who occasionally flips the board. You might win sometimes, but always keep a towel nearby to clean up the mess.

Good luck, you'll need it.

P.S. Keep excellent records of your trades. They'll come in handy during tax season and your inevitable post-mortem analysis.
