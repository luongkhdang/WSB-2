def calculate_dynamic_score(indicator_value, market_volatility, historical_accuracy):
    """Calculate a dynamic score based on market conditions and historical accuracy"""
    base_score = 10  # Base score for the indicator
    volatility_modifier = 1.0
    
    # Adjust based on market volatility (VIX or equivalent)
    if market_volatility > 30:  # High volatility
        volatility_modifier = 0.7  # Reduce weight in high volatility
    elif market_volatility < 15:  # Low volatility
        volatility_modifier = 1.3  # Increase weight in low volatility
    
    # Adjust based on historical accuracy of this indicator
    accuracy_modifier = historical_accuracy / 5.0  # Scale from 0-10 to 0-2
    
    return base_score * volatility_modifier * accuracy_modifier
2. Enhanced Volatility Incorporation
The current system calculates ATR but doesn't fully integrate it into predictions. We should:
Use ATR to define expected movement ranges for different timeframes.
Scale confidence levels based on volatility.
Adjust strike distance recommendations for credit spreads based on volatility.
3. Improved Prediction Quantification
Current predictions are vague (e.g., "bullish"). We should:
Provide specific price targets with confidence intervals.
Add probability distributions for different movement scenarios.
Calculate expected moves based on options implied volatility and compare with historical patterns.

4. Learning System Enhancement
def apply_learning_weights(base_analysis, reflection_history):
    """Apply weights learned from reflection history to current analysis"""
    if not reflection_history:
        return base_analysis
    
    # Extract learning patterns
    overestimation_pattern = calculate_overestimation_bias(reflection_history)
    indicator_reliability = calculate_indicator_reliability(reflection_history)
    
    # Adjust current analysis
    adjusted_analysis = base_analysis.copy()
    adjusted_analysis["magnitude"] *= (1 - overestimation_pattern)
    
    # Adjust indicator weights based on historical reliability
    for indicator, reliability in indicator_reliability.items():
        if indicator in adjusted_analysis["indicators"]:
            adjusted_analysis["indicators"][indicator]["weight"] *= reliability
    
    return adjusted_analysis


5. Multi-model Consensus
Instead of relying on a single analysis, we should:
Generate multiple analyses with different parameter sets.
Calculate a consensus forecast with error bounds.
Report conflicting signals and their implications.
6. Implied Volatility Integration
The pretraining process should:
Incorporate options data (IV, skew, term structure) from yfinance.
Compare historical realized volatility with implied volatility.
Use IV-based expected move calculations to validate technical predictions.
7. Specific Credit Spread Recommendations
Enhance the output to include:
Specific strike selections based on technical levels and expected move.
Probability of profit calculations.
Risk-reward ratios for different strike combinations.
Adjustment triggers based on movement thresholds.
8. Time Series Analysis Enhancement
Implement more sophisticated time series analysis:
Add autocorrelation analysis to identify cyclical patterns.
Implement pattern recognition for chart formations.
Use more advanced indicators like MACD histogram, RSI divergence.
9. Backtesting Framework
Add a backtesting component to:
Validate prediction accuracy systematically.
Compare different technical approaches.
Optimize parameters based on historical performance.
10. Adaptive Learning Loop
Create a feedback loop where:
Prediction errors automatically adjust future weightings.
Successful patterns get higher weights over time.
The system adapts to changing market regimes.
Implementation Priority
Dynamic Scoring System: Replace rigid scores with adaptive scores based on market conditions.
Enhanced Volatility Incorporation: Better ATR integration for movement ranges and confidence scaling.
Learning System Enhancement: Systematically apply learnings from reflections to future analyses.
Specific Credit Spread Recommendations: Direct strike selection guidance for 7-15 DTE spreads.
Implied Volatility Integration: Include options data in the pretraining process.
